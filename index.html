    <h2>How to Make a Perfect Sandwich:</h2>

    <ol class="list-none">
        <li>
            <b>Step 1:</b><br>
            Prepare the vegetables that you want to add to your sandwich.<br>
            Tomatoes and lettuce are common vegetables added to sandwiches.<br>
            Rinse all vegetables with clean water and dry them with a paper towel.<br>
            Slice tomatoes and any other veggies that need slicing.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Step 2:</b><br>
            Gather the materials needed on a flat ,clean, and sanitary surface.<br>
            Take out two slices of your favorite bread.<br>
            Some of the most common types of bread are white, wheat, sourdough, multigrain, etcâ€¦
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Step 3:</b><br>
            Open your favorite condiment jar.<br>
            Insert spreading knife into the jar and load the desired amount of condiment onto knife.<br>
            Then spread condiment evenly onto one side of a sliced piece of bread.<br>
            You can repeat this step for any additional condiments that you wish to eat.<br>
            You can mix some of the condiments together to try a variety of different flavors.<br>
            Which condiments you put on your sandwich is only limited by your imagination.
        </li>
    
        
        <li>
            <b>Step 4:</b><br>
            Choose your favorite protein(s) and place onto one of the pieces of bread on the side with the condiment.<br>
            Make sure to spread the protein(s) in a way will go all the way to the edge of the bread.<br>
            If your meat is round, you can slice the protein(s) in half and place the straight edges along different sides of the piece of bread.<br>
            This will allow you to enjoy the desired protein(s) flavor with every bite of your sandwich.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>Step 5:</b><br>
            Place your desired amount of the cheese you have chosen on top of the protein(s).<br>
            Make sure add enough cheese to cover the entire sandwich.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>Step 6:</b><br>
            Place the desired toppings (sliced tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, etc.) on top of your cheese.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>Step 7:</b><br>
            Place the second slice of bread with the condiment covered side down on top of your toppings.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>Step 8:</b><br>
            If desired, slice sandwich into a shape that will make it easier to handle.<br>
            Some common shapes are rectangles where you cut the sandwich down middle or triangles in which you cut the sandwich diagonally through the middle.<br>
            You may also cut it into decorative shapes like stars or hearts if you are feeling imaginative.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>Step 9:</b><br>
            Serve and enjoy your sandwich.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>Step 10:</b><br>
            If your sandwich is too dry try removing one of the slices of bread and spreading more condiments on it.<br>
            You may also try adding tomatoes or pickles to moisten your sandwich.
